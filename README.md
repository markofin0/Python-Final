# Python-Final

had to split python game and web app into two due to pygbag not working

Project Overview: A brief description of your project.

I made a game in python that took advantage of every core aspect of python we learned about this class semester. 

This includes variables, lists, objects, functions, external python libraries (I used pygame), and loops.

Installation and Setup Instructions: How to get your project up and running.

Clone from git and find main.py

Usage Guide: How to use your application, with examples if possible.

Run main.py

use the Arrow keys on your keyboard to pove around the map, while avoiding and killing enemies and picking up coins. You win the game by getting 30 coins. 

There are not enough coins on the map alone so you will need to venture out and kill enemies as they drop 1 coin each.

Testing Procedures: Detailed instructions on how to test your application.

try out the different animations, killing enemies, try to interact with blocks and coins, 

see what happens when you die and when you win, and try to restart the game when you do.
